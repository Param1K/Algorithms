int main()
{
	//	int nCount[5] = {1}; 	//the first element (nCount[0]) is set to 1. Every other element gets initialized to zero.
						// You can use this approach to initialize a large array to zero as well:
	//	int nScores[100] = {0};	//This not only declares the array but initializes every element in the array to zero


	//	int nCount[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};	//By the same token, you don’t have to provide an array size if you have an initializer list — C++ will just count the number of elements in the list and make the array that size:

	int adjMat[X][X] = {0};
